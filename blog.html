[the boys are still playing in Cartman's basement]\n


Stan: Dude, I'm almost dead.
Cartman: Kyle, cast Arcane Missle.
Kyle: I'm out of Mana, I told you.
[back at the game, Stan the warrior pulls further away from the battle with the griefer]
Stan: I've gotta heal.
[he turns around to see the battle]
Randy Marsh: [voice only] Stan!
[Stan the warrior looks around trying to determine where the voice is coming from, then turns around to see Randy's character Valkorn running toward him]
Stan: Dad? Not now!
Randy Marsh: [Valkorn the warrior] Stan! I've been sent here... to bring you this.
[he holds the Sword of a Thousand Truths aloft]
Randy Marsh: This sword can completely drain his Mana.
Stan: Dad, how did you get that?
Randy Marsh: No time! Just take it! Here!
[he finds that the sword stays fixed to his left hand]
Randy Marsh: ...How... how do you hand something from one player to another?
Stan: Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...
Randy Marsh: Okay.
[Stan throws away his old sword to get the new one]

[back in battle, the griefer sees Stan the warrior about to get the Sword of a Thousand Truths from Valkorn]
Cartman: [the dwarf, alarmed and turning to Stan] Stan, what the hell are you doing?
[the griefer runs to Stan and Valkorn, about to strike them]
Stan: [clutching the new sword] I got it!
[the griefer stabs Valkorn, who screams in pain]
Stan: [shocked] Dad!
Randy Marsh: [Valkorn the warrior, moaning] Stan...
[he falls down face first]
Stan: Dad, no!
[he turns around to face the griefer]
Stan: You killed my father!
[he walks up to the griefer and strikes him with one blow of the sword; the griefer's defenses start to crack]
Cartman: His shield and armor spells are down!
Kyle: [female mage] Attack!
[Kenny the hunter shoots an arrow into the griefer's chest; the griefer picks up Stan's old sword and Kyle fires an energy ball at the griefer, disabling him and having him fall to the ground on all fours]
Cartman: [approaching the griefer's character] Looks like you're about to get powned.
[he swings back and pulls the mallet forward]
Cartman: Heeyahh!
[the mallet smashes the head of the griefer's character into bits, while the griefer, in his apartment, is shocked that he is out of the game for good]

[the World of Warcraft characters have just defeated the griefer; Stan the warrior throws away the Sword of a Thousand Truths and walks up to his father's dying character]
Stan: [shaking Randy] Dad? Dad?
Randy Marsh: [Valkorn the warrior, answering] Staaan.
[falters a bit, but Stan holds him up]
Randy Marsh: I've never been able to say this before, but... I love you, son.
Stan: I know you do, Dad.
[Valkorn swats Stan's hand away, then moans a bit and dies]


Above are the scenes from the very last part of the video, which was really impressive to me. I wish I had a dad as cool as Randy Marsh. And if the mom of Cartman does exist, I will do anything to meet with her once.
