                        <p>My name is Leslie or Jiandan Hu, and I'll be posting on this blog for the rest of the semester. </p>
                        <h1>Make Love, Not Warcraft</h1>
                        <p>
[the boys are still playing in Cartman's basement]<br/>Stan: Dude, I'm almost dead.<br/>
Cartman: Kyle, cast Arcane Missle.<br/>
Kyle: I'm out of Mana, I told you.<br/>
[back at the game, Stan the warrior pulls further away from the battle with the griefer]<br/>
Stan: I've gotta heal.<br/>
[he turns around to see the battle]<br/>
Randy Marsh: [voice only] Stan!<br/>
[Stan the warrior looks around trying to determine where the voice is coming from, then turns around to see Randy's character Valkorn running toward him]<br/>
Stan: Dad? Not now!<br/>
Randy Marsh: [Valkorn the warrior] Stan! I've been sent here... to bring you this.<br/>
[he holds the Sword of a Thousand Truths aloft]<br/>
Randy Marsh: This sword can completely drain his Mana.<br/>
Stan: Dad, how did you get that?<br/>
Randy Marsh: No time! Just take it! Here!<br/>
[he finds that the sword stays fixed to his left hand]<br/>
Randy Marsh: ...How... how do you hand something from one player to another?<br/>
Stan: Bring up your inventory screen: Control-I...<br/>
Randy Marsh: Okay.<br/>
[Stan throws away his old sword to get the new one]<br/>
<br/>
[back in battle, the griefer sees Stan the warrior about to get the Sword of a Thousand Truths from Valkorn]<br/>
Cartman: [the dwarf, alarmed and turning to Stan] Stan, what the hell are you doing?<br/>
[the griefer runs to Stan and Valkorn, about to strike them]<br/>
Stan: [clutching the new sword] I got it!<br/>
[the griefer stabs Valkorn, who screams in pain]<br/>
Stan: [shocked] Dad!<br/>
Randy Marsh: [Valkorn the warrior, moaning] Stan...<br/>
[he falls down face first]<br/>
Stan: Dad, no!<br/>
[he turns around to face the griefer]<br/>
Stan: You killed my father!<br/>
[he walks up to the griefer and strikes him with one blow of the sword; the griefer's defenses start to crack]<br/>
Cartman: His shield and armor spells are down!<br/>
Kyle: [female mage] Attack!<br/>
[Kenny the hunter shoots an arrow into the griefer's chest; the griefer picks up Stan's old sword and Kyle fires an energy ball at the griefer, disabling him and having him fall to the ground on all fours]<br/>
Cartman: [approaching the griefer's character] Looks like you're about to get powned.<br/>
[he swings back and pulls the mallet forward]<br/>
Cartman: Heeyahh!<br/>
[the mallet smashes the head of the griefer's character into bits, while the griefer, in his apartment, is shocked that he is out of the game for good]<br/>
<br/>
[the World of Warcraft characters have just defeated the griefer; Stan the warrior throws away the Sword of a Thousand Truths and walks up to his father's dying character]<br/>
Stan: [shaking Randy] Dad? Dad?<br/>
Randy Marsh: [Valkorn the warrior, answering] Staaan.<br/>
[falters a bit, but Stan holds him up]<br/>
Randy Marsh: I've never been able to say this before, but... I love you, son.<br/>
Stan: I know you do, Dad.<br/>
[Valkorn swats Stan's hand away, then moans a bit and dies]<br/>


Above are the scenes from the very last part of the video, which was really impressive to me. I wish I had a dad as cool as Randy Marsh. And if the mom of Cartman does exist, I will do anything to meet with her once.
