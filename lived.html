		<h1>First Step Toward Becoming A Dietitian</h1>
		<p>My grandpa passed away because of coronary heart disease last year, not until then did I realize that health condition relates this close to death. Sadly, I wasn’t even able to make it to the funeral on the other side of Pacific. However I soon figured out that there was a way to “shorten” the distance to the Pacific between me and my beloved ones. Since we now have access to the Internet almost anywhere, it’s fairly easy enough for me to do something for my family members through the help of Internet.</p>
		<p>While the whole family was still in deep grief, I told myself that I must do something to help them move on. I tried so hard to tell them that even if grandpa passed away, love never dies. But I was never supportive enough to manage the pain in their hearts. Through all the methods I used, none of them brought real solace to them. </p>
		<p>On a day when I was studying in the library, my sister called me and told me that our grandma could manage the pain no more that she refused to eat and started to have some physical symptoms showed up. That’s when I started to get really worried. I felt so helpless that I couldn’t even give her a hug. I couldn’t hold back my tears when I heard my grandma complaining about aches and pains in her stomach, uncontrollable nausea, and significant weight loss. There must be something I could do! There must be something I could do!</p>
		<p>Knowing that there’s no elixir of life in the world but there are scientifically proved ways to live a healthy lifestyle, I met with my academic advisor and enrolled in a nutrition course. I told myself that, this time, I don’t study for GPA or anything, but for the sake of love. Pretty soon we were introduced to a software called Diet Analysis Plus. Diet Analysis Plus allows users to track their diet and physical activity, and analyze the nutritional value of the food they eat so they can adjust their diets to reach personal health goals--all while gaining a better understanding of how nutrition relates to, and impacts, their lives. Diet Analysis Plus includes a 20,000+ food database; customizable reports; new assignable labs; custom food and recipe features; the latest Dietary Reference Intakes; and goals and actual percentages of essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. Features include enhanced search functionality with filter option, easy-to-use instructor page, and resources tab with helpful information.</p>
		<p>Since my grandma hadn’t been eat well neither right, I decided to give it a try and started to work on her daily diet as my first step to help her out. I asked my sister to help me track when and what my grandma had been eating throughout the whole day, and then input those into Diet Analysis Plus for further analysis. Not at all unexpected, she’s been eating so poorly that she wouldn’t even be able to function normally with that diet. With the help of Diet Analysis Plus, I came up with a personalized healthy diet plan for my grandma. Thanks to all the relatives who had been taking care of my grandma, she gradually started to eat better and was eventually able to maintain sufficient nutrition from a diet that she enjoyed. To my amusement, she started to engage herself in moving her body, she would go for a short walk, or even go to swim with my uncle. Not only that, but she also get massage and listen to music to relax herself. It’s worth mentioning that she went to the synagogue on a weekly basis to obtain spiritual nourishment. Though her schedule was pretty simplified, she managed herself to live a full life.</p>
		<p>I also share a lot of useful information to my parents. I told my dad about the bad sides of smoking and alcohol. I asked my mom and dad to keep a diet record, and input those data of what they had been eating daily into Diet Analysis to have it analyzed. A few days later I sent them the report of how their diet has been evaluated. Surprisingly, my efforts really helped my mom to have a better understanding of what she’s been consuming, so that she could design her specially customized plan of losing weight. Both my mom and dad took my work and were really happy about the fact that their daughter could help them to adapt to a healthier lifestyle. She thought her world collapsed as grandpa passed away, but now we will have to admit that her world has been slowly rebuilt. Through her loss, she was actually pushed to live a whole new life. For over 50 years my grandparents’ lives overlapped, all the precious memories of them together are certainly rich enough for my grandma to live an even better life.</p>
		<p>The whole thing made me think that maybe going for dietetics is worth a try. The freshness and novelty of things usually wear off pretty soon for me, but to think of making people around me healthier as my career, I probably will never get tired of it even if I have to do that everyday. Especially when you see people you love could get professional assistance from you to eat and live healthier, you really feel fully and satisfied. </p>
		<p>The major Dietetics prepares students to use advanced knowledge about food and nutrition to help prevent and treat disease and maintain and promote health.  It is people-oriented, science-focused, and evidence-based. It really is first step toward a professional credential. For persons who choose this major, they are expected to acquire approximately equal expertise in nutritional assessment and care and in foodservice management systems. And later they can develop special interests through the selection of elective courses. I’ll have to say that the experience of utilizing the software called Diet Analysis Plus has impacted my choice of dietetics as my undergraduate major a lot. Honestly speaking, to some points, dietitians can be as cool as technicians!</p>
