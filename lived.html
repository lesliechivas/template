		<h1>First Step Toward Becoming A Dietitian</h1>
		<p>My grandpa passed away because of coronary heart disease last year, not until then did I realize that health condition relates this close to death. Sadly, I wasn’t even able to make it to the funeral on the other side of Pacific. However I soon figured out that there was a way to “shorten” the distance to the Pacific between me and my beloved ones. Since we now have access to the Internet almost anywhere, it’s fairly easy enough for me to do something for my family members through the help of Internet.</p>
		<p>While the whole family was still in deep grief, I told myself that I must do something to help them move on. I tried so hard to tell them that even if grandpa passed away, love never dies. But I was never supportive enough to manage the pain in their hearts. Through all the methods I used, none of them brought real solace to them. </p>
		<p>On a day when I was studying in the library, my sister called me and told me that our grandma could manage the pain no more that she refused to eat and started to have some physical symptoms showed up. That’s when I started to get really worried. I felt so helpless that I couldn’t even give her a hug. I couldn’t hold back my tears when I heard my grandma complaining about aches and pains in her stomach, uncontrollable nausea, and significant weight loss. There must be something I could do! There must be something I could do!</p>
